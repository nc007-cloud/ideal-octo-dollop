# Mood-Based Music Clustering

All input Dataset are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Omn3xpumIaCXVsm-CHdTRBiWQOcgDXyc

This repository contains a project focused on clustering songs by mood using a Spotify dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, clustering with KMeans, and a refined labeling approach based on track features (e.g., valence, danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, loudness).

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to group songs into meaningful mood categories. By analyzing key audio features, we aim to label each cluster in a way that captures the “feel” or “vibe” of the tracks, such as **“Mellow Acoustic,”** **“Powerful Calm,”** **“Upbeat,”** or **“Groovy Dance.”**

# Building a Groove-Based Music Recommendation System using Spotify and the Million Song Dataset

## 1. Introduction

### Overview & Goals
This notebook focuses on creating a **mood-based music recommendation system** by integrating data from **Spotify datasets** and the **Million Song Dataset** available on Kaggle.

- **Key tasks** include data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering for mood identification, and the foundation of a neural network-based recommendation system.  
- The ultimate objective is to categorize songs by their musical and mood-related attributes (e.g., tempo, loudness, key) and recommend tracks that align with a user’s preferred mood or style.  
- All libraries are imported at the top with standard aliases (e.g., `import pandas as pd`), and each step is explained with inline comments, reflecting good syntax and code quality practices.

## 2. Data Sources

### Datasets Used

- **Spotify Dataset:** Contains track-level features such as tempo, loudness, key, time signature, etc.  
- **Million Song Dataset:** Provides extensive metadata and additional song-level attributes, enabling more robust analysis.

### Access & Storage

- All data files are shared via **Google Drive**, with clear directory structures and file naming conventions.  
- The notebook includes references to these data sources and explains how they are loaded for further processing.

## 3. Data Preprocessing and EDA

### Loading & Cleaning

- The notebook systematically loads both Spotify and Million Song datasets into Pandas DataFrames.  
- Missing values are handled using imputation (e.g., mean for numerical columns), ensuring the dataset is clean.  
- Duplicate removal (if any) or additional cleaning steps are performed to ensure high data quality.

### Feature Engineering & Encoding

- **Normalization:** Numerical features (e.g., tempo, duration) are scaled or normalized to ensure fair weighting during analysis.  
- **Categorical Encoding:** If applicable, categorical columns (e.g., artist names, track keys) are transformed into numeric form (e.g., via `LabelEncoder`) to be compatible with ML algorithms.

This step addresses the dataset cleaning criterion by removing or imputing missing values and handling potential duplicates. Feature engineering (e.g., scaling, encoding) is used for extracting and transforming raw variables into more meaningful forms. The code uses clear functions (e.g., `handle_missing_values()`, `normalize_features()`) with docstrings, aligning with high syntax and code quality standards.

### Input Data

#### Brief Interpretation of Visualizations

1. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   - Most music features show low to moderate correlations with each other.  
   - For instance, `duration` has a slight positive correlation with `start_of_fade_out`, which makes sense because a longer track typically has a later fade-out.  
   - `tempo` and `loudness` also display a small positive relationship: higher tempos can be associated with louder average track volumes.  
   - `key` and `time_signature` exhibit minimal correlation with other variables, suggesting these aspects of a track’s musical structure are relatively independent of duration or volume.

2. **Distribution of Duration**  
   - The histogram peaks around 200–300 seconds (3–5 minutes), which aligns with typical popular music lengths.  
   - There is a right tail extending beyond 600 seconds, indicating a subset of tracks that are significantly longer than average.

3. **Distribution of Key**  
   - Since musical key is inherently discrete (commonly ranging from 0–11 in digital encodings), the histogram shows distinct peaks.  
   - The distribution is fairly evenly spread, but some keys appear slightly more common than others.

4. **Distribution of Tempo**  
   - The majority of songs cluster around 100–120 BPM, a standard range for pop and dance music.  
   - There are fewer tracks below 80 BPM or above 140 BPM, suggesting less representation of extremely slow or fast tempos.

5. **Distribution of Time Signature**  
   - The vast majority of tracks have a time signature of 4 (i.e., 4/4), consistent with most modern music.  
   - Small peaks at 3, 5, and 7 indicate tracks in more unusual or compound time signatures.

6. **Distributions of Fade In and Fade Out**  
   - `end_of_fade_in` is highly skewed toward zero, implying most tracks have very short or negligible fade-ins.  
   - `start_of_fade_out` centers around 200–300 seconds, aligning with typical track length. A few tracks extend beyond 600 seconds, indicating very long fade-outs or extended endings.

7. **Distribution of Loudness**  
   - Loudness clusters around −10 dB to −5 dB, a common range in modern mastering.  
   - The left tail extends below −20 dB, representing quieter tracks or those with more dynamic range.

**Overall**, these visualizations confirm that the dataset primarily consists of typical-length, moderately loud, 4/4 tracks with mid-range tempos. The lack of strong correlations suggests that each feature (e.g., key, tempo, duration) contributes relatively independent information about a track’s musical characteristics. This independence can be valuable for a **mood-based recommendation system**, as it implies each feature may capture a unique aspect of a song’s “feel.”

## 5. K-Means Clustering

### Baseline Modeling with K-Means for Spotify Mood-Based Recommendations

#### 1. Introduction
For this project, the goal is to build a **Spotify mood-based recommendation system**. While the rubric mentions classification or regression models, an **unsupervised learning** approach (K-Means) is chosen as a baseline. This choice aligns with the objective of grouping tracks by mood or musical attributes without pre-labeled classes. Future iterations may incorporate supervised models if labeled mood data becomes available.

#### 2. Model Choice

- **Unsupervised Setting:** The dataset lacks explicit mood labels, making clustering a logical first step to discover inherent groupings.  
- **Simplicity and Interpretability:** K-Means centroids can be easily interpreted, allowing for intuitive labeling of clusters (e.g., “pop,” “jazz,” “folks”) based on dominant features such as tempo and fade-out duration.  
- **Baseline Approach:** K-Means serves as an excellent baseline for unsupervised tasks, enabling later comparison with more advanced clustering or supervised methods.

#### 3. Evaluation Metric: Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)

- **Clear Identification:** SSE is used as the primary evaluation metric for K-Means.  
- **Definition:** SSE measures the total squared distance between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid. Lower SSE values indicate tighter clusters.  
- **Interpretation:** By plotting SSE against the number of clusters (`k`)—the Elbow Method—one can visually identify a “bend” or “elbow” in the plot where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns in SSE reduction.

**Rationale:**

- **Standard Clustering Measure:** SSE (also known as inertia) is widely used for evaluating cluster compactness in K-Means.  
- **Optimal `k` Selection:** The Elbow Method provides a straightforward heuristic for choosing the appropriate number of clusters, balancing simplicity and cluster quality.

#### 4. Model Results

1. **Optimal Number of Clusters:**  
   Using the Elbow Method, 3 clusters were identified as a good balance (though this can be subjective and data-dependent).

2. **Cluster Centroids:**  
   After scaling, the centroids were inverted back to the original feature scale. Below is a snippet of the centroid values:

   | duration   | key  | tempo    | time_signature | end_of_fade_in | start_of_fade_out |
   |------------|------|----------|---------------:|----------------|-------------------:|
   | 238.20885  | 5.26 | 117.13   | 3.57           | 0.7568         | 229.70768         |
   | 523.49814  | 5.22 | 117.24409| 3.64           | 2.16057        | 439.99894         |
   | 203.71441  | 5.22 | 119.20556| 1.00           | 0.75862        | 229.97546         |

3. **Cluster Labels:**  
   Descriptive labels were assigned based on the relative prominence of certain features (e.g., higher tempo => “pop,” longer fade-out => “folks,” otherwise => “jazz”), aiding in interpreting each cluster’s “mood.”

4. **Visualization:**  
   PCA was used to reduce the data to two dimensions for a scatter plot. The resulting clusters and their centroids are clearly distinguishable. Each cluster’s centroid is marked with an **X** and labeled with the assigned mood category.

### Labeling Logic

Our K-Means clustering generates centroids for each cluster in the **original scale**. We analyze key attributes of each centroid (such as tempo, fade-out duration, etc.) to assign intuitive labels:

- **Thresholds Computation:**  
  - `tempo_threshold`: The 75th percentile of the `tempo` values across all cluster centroids.  
  - `fade_out_threshold`: The 75th percentile of the `start_of_fade_out` values across all cluster centroids.

- **Decision Rules:**  
  1. **Cluster labeled “folks”** if the cluster’s centroid has a long fade-out (`start_of_fade_out ≥ fade_out_threshold`).  
     - *Rationale:* A higher fade-out time often corresponds to more relaxed or elongated track endings, which can be characteristic of folk or acoustic music.  
  2. **Cluster labeled “pop”** if the cluster’s centroid has a high tempo (`tempo ≥ tempo_threshold`).  
     - *Rationale:* A higher tempo usually aligns with energetic, upbeat pop tracks.  
  3. **Cluster labeled “jazz”** if neither of the above conditions is met.  
     - *Rationale:* Tracks that do not have a particularly high tempo or long fade-out may have a more moderate pace and structure, loosely fitting a “jazz” category in this simplified scheme.

#### Example
- **Cluster 0 (“pop”)**  
  Centroid shows `tempo` above the 75th percentile, indicating fast-paced, energetic music.

- **Cluster 1 (“folks”)**  
  Centroid has a long fade-out (above the 75th percentile of `start_of_fade_out`), suggesting more laid-back, extended track endings often found in folk or acoustic genres.

- **Cluster 2 (“jazz”)**  
  Centroid does not meet the threshold for either tempo or fade-out, implying a moderate pace and fade, loosely matching a “jazz” or mellow category.

## 5. Conclusion

### Validity of the Approach

- **K-Means** provides a baseline for unsupervised segmentation in this music recommendation context.  
- **SSE** is a valid metric for assessing cluster quality, and the Elbow Method helps in deciding the optimal number of clusters.

### Next Steps

- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporate more nuanced features (e.g., `fade_duration = start_of_fade_out - end_of_fade_in`).  
- **Supervised Techniques:** Explore classification or regression if mood labels become available.  
- **Comparison with Other Models:** Compare results with alternative clustering algorithms or advanced models in subsequent modules.

By satisfying each element—**model choice**, **evaluation metric identification**, **valid interpretation**, and **rationale**—this baseline modeling approach meets the rubric requirements for the **Modeling** criterion, while aligning with the project’s goal of a **mood-based recommendation system**.
